## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

While building this project, i mostly learned how to center a div horizontally and vertically by using 
CSS position property and transform property. I did this as highlighted below;-

```css
#wrapper{
  position: absolute;
  left: 50%;
  top: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  text-align: center;
  width: 400px;
  padding: 20px;
  border-radius: 8px;
  background-color: #fff;
}
```

### Continued development

I built this project based on desktop design, while no mobile-design flow and functionalities were implemented. Hence I would like to focus more on mobile design in the near future and add some functionalities with JavaScript, which will allow visitor to create accounts and login to see more features.
